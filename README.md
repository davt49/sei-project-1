General Assembly Project 1: Vanilla JS Web Game
==========================
1 week long personal project using only html, css and vanilla javascript.



I picked Tetris as I've always been a fan of the sandbox type of games with randomised outcomes.


Theme
==========
The theme is specifically inspired by an instrumental album I've been listening to. There are songs on the music player that provides the ambiance for this background of a luxurious, warm safe haven from the wintry cold outside. Overall I wanted to create a relaxing atmosphere for this game, I'd like to think the music is integral to the theme.

Controls
===========
Left, down and right arrow keys for movement.
Up arrow for blocks rotation.

Game starts automatically.
Reset button will clear the board and reset the score.

Play button will start a random song.
Stop button will stop the music.
